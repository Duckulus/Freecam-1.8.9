# `Freecam`
A Freecam Mod for Forge 1.8.9

Freecam is a mod that lets you explore the world as a ghost while your body stays in the same place. The mod should not be able to be detected by servers but this is not guaranteed.

## Installation

This mod can be used both as a Forge Mod or as a Labymod Addon. Using it as a LabyMod addon allows you to easily configure it ingame.

To get the mod, download the latest Release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Duckulus/Freecam-1.8.9/releases) page or compile the mod using gradle and the latest jdk.

To use it with forge jut put the resulting jar ending in `-all.jar` into the `mods` folder of your forge instance. To use it as a LabyMod addon put it in the `LabyMod/addons-1.8` folder.
